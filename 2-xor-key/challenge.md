# 2: XOR Image "Encryption"

You have been given a key and a .png image which was encrypted using that same key.

The encryption scheme is simple: XOR every byte of the data together, with the key repeating if needed. To decrypt the image, you must apply the key in the above manner to the encrypted image.

Your program should save the result to a file (with any name you choose). You will know the program is correct when you get a readable .png image out.
